![preview](https://github.com/nickkunz/particlecloud/blob/master/media/custom_particle_cloud_sim.gif)

This small project was conducted for the purpose of exploring interactive visual experiments with particle simulators. It is a modified version of the Cloud example contained in the Traer Physics library (a simple physics engine).

The application is written in the Processing 3 IDE, which can be downloaded at https://www.processing.org/download and executed manually with the Traer Physics library, which can be downloaded at http://murderandcreate.com/physics. Alternatively, the application can be executed stand alone on either Mac or PC from its respective application folder. Enjoy!
